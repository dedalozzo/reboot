# PitBootstrap

Bootstrap is the front-end framework for the PitPress platform, created and maintained by [Filippo Fadda](https://it.linkedin.com/in/filippofadda).


## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, PitBootstrap will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch);
* new additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch);
* bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch.
